# Torped

_Torped_ is slang for _hitman_ in Swedish. Like many others who started programming as a kid, I dreamed about creating the perfect game. My brainchild was named _Torped_ and has guided me in my endeavors in the world of programming. It made it clear to me that I would need to learn a lot of math and a lot of programming in order to be able to create the game that I wanted. It has been a guiding star during my childhood and early adulthood. I wouldn't be the person I am today if it wasn't for this game, even though it is nowhere near completion yet. This repository can be seen as a revival of my efforts or perhaps CPR for my childhood dreams.

The game might be described as a first person physics sandbox game. The player character and his surroundings are simulated in a finer degree than in most games. It is common practice to simulate characters in games as cylinders or capsules fixed in upright poses sliding on perfectly flat floors and against perfectly flat walls in a mostly static environment. The characters are not propelled by legs, the legs are added as graphical afterthought to make things look better. In Torped on the other hand, the characters interact with the world in a delicate way. They walk with legs and feet. They pick things up with their hands. Running into a wall at full speed is not a pleasant experience in the real world and doing so in Torped will have a similar dramatic effect.

See [spec](docs/spec.md) for a technical description of the game.
